1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
High ceilings that eat and leave no crumbs.

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,960
Hey, neighbors.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,920
Beth Anderson here, your Cura D'Alene and Liberty Lake

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,920
realtor.

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,600
That viral TikTok?

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,680
Chef's kiss.

7
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,680
Those soaring ceilings make any space

8
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,980
feel like a hug from the mountains, open, airy,

9
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,160
and full of that Idaho magic.

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,080
Here in our community, vaulted ceilings aren't just pretty.

11
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,200
They're perfect for framing lake views from Liberty Lake homes

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:32,320
or hosting epic family gatherings under the stars.

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,680
I once walked a client through a Cura D'Alene gem

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,360
where the high ceilings turned game night into a palace party,

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,320
kids running wild, laughter echoing forever.

16
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,680
The video nails it.

17
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,119
No crumbs left on style.

18
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,000
But watch for natural wood beams to add

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,799
that warm, local cabin vibe.

20
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,880
Pro move?

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:56,040
Pair them with big windows for sunlight that dances all day.

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:58,520
Living the high ceiling life?

23
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,680
It's our lifestyle.

24
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,160
