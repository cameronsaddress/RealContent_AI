Hey neighbors! Have you seen this viral dancing realtor going all out for her unsold gem?

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,399
Look at that hustle! I'll be honest, I love this energy. What people don't see behind the fun

3
00:00:10,399 --> 00:00:16,159
dances and persistence is the real grind of real estate. That home in Owensboro hasn't sold yet,

4
00:00:16,159 --> 00:00:20,239
but she's not quitting. And neither do I here in Coeur d'Alene and Liberty Lake.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,959
My experience tells me homes linger sometimes due to pricing hiccups,

6
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:28,159
market shifts, or just needing that fresh marketing spark.

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:34,080
Locally, our lake views and mountain vibes make properties hot, but I've turned stalled listings

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,759
around with virtual tours, targeted open houses, and creative staging that highlights those Idaho

9
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:45,599
sunsets. Persistence pays. Treat yourself to a bold strategy and watch it move.
